Project Title: Music Industry Agent, Artist, and Data Directory  
---------------------------------------------------------
Project Data: Music Agents, Music Agencies, Music Data  
---------------------------------------------------------
Project Overview:  

The data set we have is data scraped from a music industry website called Pollstar & Bands in town. This information contains "Agencies", "Agents", "Artists", contact info, as well as "Historical Performance" data.   

We will be cleaning, formating, and merging these datasets from 4 separate CSV files to make a full data set for analysis.  

We will also be making some Pandas dataframes that analyse the agencies within the list.   

We will create database tables for Agents, Agencies, and Artists. We will write our dataframes into CSVs, and load those CSV records into Postgres.
